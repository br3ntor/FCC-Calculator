# FCC-Calculator
Calculator project for Free Code Camp

[Take a look](https://br3ntor.github.io/FCC-Calculator/)

Branch is called change_bg_color but I'm just going to edit the readme instead.
This will be merged with master hopefully.

^Just text to mess around with github, like this text! (Merge was success!)

## Fellow FCC Classmates
**HEY YOU**
Yea you! 
Try and break this calculator! If you can, submit it as a bug in the issues or clone it, fix it and submit it as pull request.
If you're reading this you might might need practice with github like me so go ahead and experiment with any interaction here even if it's just issues that say 'hi' or pull requests from a branch you've made that just changes the background.
