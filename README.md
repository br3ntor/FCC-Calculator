**HEY YOU**

Yea you! 

Try and break this calculator! If you can, submit it as a bug in the issues or clone it, fix it and submit it as pull request.
If you're reading this you might might need practice with github like me so go ahead and experiment with any interaction here even if it's just issues that say 'hi' or pull requests from a branch you've made that just changes the background.

**Attention: This branch was created on github as an experiment**
I first created this branch on the github website with the intention of working on it locally
It didn't show up as my local branches. So I had to type `git branch -a` to see then switch to it then pull.
Idk I'm still figuring this all out and it's kind of fun.
